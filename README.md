# House_Price_Prediction
House Price Prediction
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using a machine learning model. The primary library used for the regression model is XGBoost (XGBRegressor). The project includes data preprocessing steps such as feature scaling and utilizes libraries such as pandas and matplotlib for data handling and visualization.

Libraries and Tools Used
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
matplotlib: Data visualization
scikit-learn: Machine learning utilities and model evaluation
XGBoost: Implementation of the XGBoost regression algorithm
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate house prices based on a dataset containing various features of the houses. The main steps involved in the project are:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values
Feature scaling
Encoding categorical variables
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing the data distribution
Understanding relationships between features
Model Building:

Using XGBRegressor from the XGBoost library to build the predictive model
Training the model on the dataset
Model Evaluation:

Evaluating the model performance using R-squared (RÂ²) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics
The R-squared score of the model is 0.998, indicating a very high level of accuracy in predictions
The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the model is 11.016, indicating the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual house prices
